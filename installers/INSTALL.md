## Unreleased Installer Package

I plan to provide an unreleased installer package here if you want to try the unreleased features. When available, the unreleased installer `capl-vector-unreleased.vsix` can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/kmasif/capl-vector/blob/master/installers/capl-vector-unreleased.vsix).

Remember that you can always copy the whole source code and run it as an extension. To do this:

1. Download the [latest code](https://github.com/kmasif/capl-vector/archive/master.zip) (a zip file)
2. Extract the contents
3. Copy the extracted contents to your local extension folder
4. (*Optional*) You can delete the `/installers` folder altogether

### Location of local extensions folder

- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
- macOS / Linux: `$HOME/.vscode/extensions`

> If you are using the insiders edition, you will have `.vscode-insiders` instead of `.vscode`.
