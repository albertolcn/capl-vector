# Vector CAPL Support for Visual Studio Code

Communication Access Programming Language (**CAPL**) allows programming of network node models and write test modules in several [Vector](https://vector.com) applications such as CANoe, CANalyzer, and vTESTstudio.

This extension helps you to use Visual Studio Code (*vscode*) as the Code Editor of choice instead of built-in **CAPL** Browser.

## DISCLAIMER

This is an **unofficial extension**. There is no affiliation with the official product.

*vscode* is my preferred code editor for all things programming. Since I am currently writing **CAPL** codes and there was no support of **CAPL** in *vscode*, I decided to write one for myself and to help fellow **CAPL** users who wants the benefit of *vscode*.
